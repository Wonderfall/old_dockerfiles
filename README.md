## Dockerfiles

**Docker Hub builds : https://hub.docker.com/u/wonderfall/**

#### Intro
Why the hell should we download an entire Ubuntu system when we can do something extremly lightweight? This is the mainly reason that made me to write my own Dockerfiles. I use only what I need, nothing more. On top of that, I want flexibility (for instance, environment variables are useful), and scalability. Readability is also important since maintaining Dockerfiles up-to-date is not that easy.

#### Projects
- **cowrie** : a SSH honeypot.
- **deluge** : a BitTorrent client.
- **ghost** : a simple blog CMS.
- **nodejs** : node.js environment built from source. *(not automated)*
- **nsd** : an authoritative DNS server.
- **owncloud** : a free platform offering file hosting services.
- **reverse** : nginx statically linked against LibreSSL. *(not automated)*
- **searx** : a metasearch engine.
- **subsonic** : a web-based media server with transcoding abilities.

*Not automated means there's no automation on Docker Hub. I build on my own server then I push. If you're not confident with this, please build yourself!*

#### Contact
I write and maintain Dockefiles for my own, because it'll suit my needs. Don't ask me for writing and maintaing something I don't need. Moreover, writing dockerfiles is so easy. Perhaps mine will inspire you to do something pretty good (though I actually  don't pretend to do so...)! If you encounter a bug, or if something needs to be updated, leave a comment at Docker Hub, open an issue on Github or email me at *wonderfall at mondedie dot fr*.
