## Dockerfiles

**Docker Hub builds : https://hub.docker.com/u/wonderfall/**

#### Intro
Why the hell should we download an entire Ubuntu system when we can do something extremly lightweight? This is the main reason that made me to write my own Dockerfiles. I use only what I need, nothing more. On top of that, I want flexibility (for instance, environment variables are useful), and scalability. Readability is also important since maintaining Dockerfiles up-to-date isn't that easy.

#### Projects
- **cowrie** : a SSH honeypot.
- **deluge** : a BitTorrent client.
- **ghost** : a simple blog CMS.
- **nodejs** : node.js environment built from source. *(not automated)*
- **nsd** : an authoritative DNS server.
- **owncloud** : a free platform offering file hosting services.
- **reverse** : nginx statically linked against LibreSSL. *(not automated)*
- **searx** : a metasearch engine.
- **subsonic** : a web-based media server with transcoding abilities.
- **piwik** : a free (as freedom) and open-source web analytics application.
- **wallabag** : a free read-it-later app, alternative to Pocket.
- **rainloop** : a simple, modern and fast webmail client.
- **isso** : a commenting server, alternative to Disqus.
- **lutim** : an image hosting service.
- **lufi** : a file hosting service.

*Not automated means there's no automation on Docker Hub. I build on my own server then I push. If you're not confident with this, please build yourself!*

#### Contact
I write and maintain Dockefiles for my own, because they suit my own needs. Don't ask me for writing and maintaing something I don't need, I'm sure you can do something pretty good. If you encounter a bug, or if something needs to be updated, leave a comment at Docker Hub, open an issue on Github or email me at *wonderfall at mondedie dot fr*. I'm open to any possible enhancement.
